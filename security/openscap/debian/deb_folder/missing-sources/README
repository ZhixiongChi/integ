Missing source files
--------------------

OpenScap ships a minified jquery library for the documentation.

For Debian, all sources are required, so we grabbed the sources from the above
project(s) or from the various upstream projects, and put them in the
missin-sources directory.

Last synchronization was made with OpenScap version 1.2.3
