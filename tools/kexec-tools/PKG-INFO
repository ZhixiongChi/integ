Description:
/sbin/kexec is a user space utility for loading another kernel
and asking the currently running kernel to do something with it.
A currently running kernel may be asked to start the loaded
kernel on reboot, or to start the loaded kernel after it panics.

The panic case is useful for having an intact kernel for writing
crash dumps.  But other uses may be imagined.
