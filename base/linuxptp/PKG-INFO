Description:
This software is an implementation of the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)
according to IEEE standard 1588 for Linux. The dual design goals are to
provide a robust implementation of the standard and to use the most
relevant and modern Application Programming Interfaces (API) offered by
the Linux kernel. Supporting legacy APIs and other platforms is not a
goal.

Platform: UNKNOWN
